## Introduction

In this analysis, we explore the relationship between life expectancy and population over time.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
gapminder_df = pd.read_csv("gapminder.csv")

# Plot the relationship between life expectancy and population
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(gapminder_df['population_millions'], gapminder_df['life_expectancy'])
plt.title('Life Expectancy vs Population')
plt.xlabel('Population (Millions)')
plt.ylabel('Life Expectancy (Years)')
plt.show()
